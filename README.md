The floating-point adder takes two floating-point numbers as input and performs the addition operation to produce the sum as the output. The input numbers typically consist of a sign bit, an exponent, and a mantissa (also known as significand or fraction). The exponent represents the scale of the number, and the mantissa represents the fractional part.
